# PhocasFoodRestaurant

a fast food chain mostly using data that we have made up. Our
project has two user classes that include employees and customers.

A customer can create an online order for himself/herself by providing the
necessary information.

An employee can login using his/her name and employee ID. An employee can
then modify our database by adding any of the following: order, item, store, menu or
item. An employee can also delete a menu, delete an employee or modify the status of
an order at any time. In addition an employee can search the database for any of the
following: instances of any of the entities in our database, list the employee IDs working
at a store, find a store that has all the menus, sales of each store, sales of each
province, find the most expensive item and find the least expensive item.
